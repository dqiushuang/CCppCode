This repository contains source code of Peking judge online and some practice for data structure and algorithms.
This repository only contains the code since May 2013. The files which their names begin with "P***_" are accepted by
POJ unless indicated..

As some of the source codes are edited in VS 2010, the head of files may contains code like "#include "stdafx.h"", and 
the definition of main function may be _tmain. What you have to do is just deleting the above including and changing _tmain
to main.
